# MyQuotesApp : MyQuotesApp uses Quotable API to generate random quotes; it allows you sto elect your favorites, post them on Twitter, also you can print/export them as PDF. In the search t,ab you can also search for a tag to find related quotes.

I prepared this app for React Dersleri youtube channel, React Dersleri provides high-quality education resources on React in Turkish.

I used:
- React JS Hooks and functional components for structure,
- Material UI, reacts,tap and some CSS for UI,
- Redux for global store management,
- react-to-print to print react components as PDF
